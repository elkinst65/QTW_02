From our studies in the class, there are many ways to address the problem of missing data but what is the best way to handle this problem [1].  The common types of missing data are: (1) MCAR (Missing completely at random), (2) MAR (Missing at Random), (3) MNAR (Missing Not at Random).  \n",

In the initial \"CARMPG\" data set, there were missing values for the engine type and cylinders variables.   We could have used either the PROC GLM or the PROC MIXED SAS command to do our analysis to predict the initial linear regression model.  The PROC GLM or PROC SAS command internally handles the categorical variables - dummy variable approach.  When one uses the PROG REG SAS command, you must manually set up the dummy variables for the categorical variables that are used in the linear regression model.   For this exercise, our team did not attempt to do this, we treated all variables as continuous variables in order to focus on the exercise."

This works on large data sets with tens of thousands of rows or more (if there are only a handful of missing values), but the repercussions are more pronounced on smaller data sets such as this one. Deleting an entire record may unintentionally obfuscate other characteristics about the dataset which may be vital to an accurate model, or bias the effect on variance. In short, every effort should be made to preserve the original characteristics of a dataset.\n",

    "Examining the fit diagnostics for MPG is shown in [Figure 4.6](#Fit with Imputation). These diagrams show a fairly random residual cloud, right skewness, and few outliers. But this time, the residual cloud has better randomness. There is a strong prediction of MPG from the indpendent variables with an adjusted $R^2=.91$ compared to .88 (original). This means 91% of MPG can be explained by the other variables. No data points provide strong leverage.\n",

    "Examining the residual diagrams in [Figure 4.7](#Residual with Imputation) show two categories; i.e., engine and cylinders, but you can see random data was added for these classes from the imputation. This isn't realistic because engine type and clinders must be from a defined set of values. The data insights are similar to the above no imputation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters for the linear regression is shown in [Figure 4.8](#Parameters Combined). Cylinders and Engine Type parameters became significant in addition to HP at alpha = .05. This might be due to the non-standard cylinder and engine types imputed. Further analysis should be performed to determine a reason why they became significant. The parameters still show that a smaller engine car yields a higher MPG, but the effect of HP dropped from .195 to .16."

Using more data in the model will provide it with more power; thereby, more accurately representing its population. Multiple imputation provides an analysis that does the following:\n",
    "- \"reflects the uncertainty due to missing values,\n",
